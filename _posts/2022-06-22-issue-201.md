This is it. The final goodbye of Swift Weekly Brief.

We are now dorment for almost half a year and after a quick discussion Kristaps and I feel it is time to make good on our promise to delete the entire list's data.

We loved having you as readers, but we love respecting your data even more.

We do want to suggest another list to look at:

- Recently Cihat has been killing it on his new list with a very similar purpose to ours. If you liked Swift Weekly Brief, you will love his newsletter. So [sign up on his Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/Jeehut), give him a follow too. If you are not into Twitter or would like to use a dedicated email address: [This is the same newsletter but on Revue](https://se-monthly.flinedev.com/)

Thank you for you time and attention,
[Kristaps](https://kristaps.me/) and [Jeroen](https://appforce1.net)
